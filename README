This package will attempt to execute a function (closure or callable) until a set number of attempts have been made.

It will intercept exceptions (and store them for reporting) and enables you to have significant control over how the function is handled during error conditions.

It's great for access to remote URLs or databases where you risk experiencing failures.

Note, it relies on exceptions to detect "failure" which will cause another attempt.

For further information, please see the "examples" folder.

More info will come later.
